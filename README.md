# Roman Numerals Kata
## A kata using TDD to implement a Roman Numerals calculator.

Write a program that takes a Roman numeral as input and outputs the corresponding Arabic number. For example, if the input is XLIII, the output is 43.

Once you can translate from RN -> Arabic, then implement the reverse conversion from Arabic -> RN. For example, if the input is 43, then the output is XLIII.

This is a TDD exercise, so build your program incrementally by writing unit tests.
