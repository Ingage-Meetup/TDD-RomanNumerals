# Roman Numerals Kata
A kata using TDD to implement a Roman Numerals calculator.

Create a program that implements a Roman Numeral translator. 

The program takes a Roman numeral as input and outputs the corresponding Arabic number. For example, if the input is XLIII, the output is 43.

Once you can translate from RN -> Arabic, then do the same thing to convert Arabic -> RN.

This is a TDD exercise, so build your program incrementally by writing tests.

Here's a good reference: http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html

Good luck! (edited)
